CharacterAnalysis:

This project's objective is all about predicting and analysing a particular person's character based on their answers for the given set of questions. 
 
Tools used:
Rstudio,
NetBeans,
NaiveBayes

1)INTRODUCTION

Personality identification of a human being by their nature an old technique. Earlier these were done manually by spending lot of time to predict the nature of the person. Data mining is primarily used today by companies with a strong consumer focus - retail, financial, communication, and marketing organizations.

2)OBJECTIVES:

This project's objective is all about predicting and analysing a particular person's character based on their answers for the given set of questions. This process is carried out using the naive bayes technique used in data mining. The user is asked to answer a set of questions which are helpful for finding their character. This can be done for a large crowd too.

3)SCOPE OF PROJECT:
  
Social network analysis has increased tremendously in recent times.To extract the personality of the authors on the social networking websites is very much useful for much application in various domains like ncludng job success,happiness,attractiveness.personality detection from text means to extract the behaviour characterstic of authors written in the text.

3)DATA STRUCTURES  AND ALGORITHMS  USED:

•	Naive Bayes Algorithm
•	Decision Tree Algorithm

4)RESULTS:
 
 The outcome expected is a character of a person.The user character is examined and which personality of the movie does the user resemble is the expected outcome.
 
5)CONCLUSION/DISCUSSION:

•	It has access to large amounts of person behavioral data. Helps to classify people using Automated personality classification (APC).

•	In this project, the system proposes an advanced APC – automated personality classification system.

•	The system uses learning algorithms like Naive Bayes and SVM, Decision tree along with advanced data mining to mine user characteristics data and learn from the patterns.
